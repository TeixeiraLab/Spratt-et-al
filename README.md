# Spratt-et-al.
DNA-PAINT codes to filter non-specific binding events, unwanted localizations and calculate the distance between clusters.

RNA-seq codes to analyzie transcription sequencing data from mouse adipocytes treated with both free insulin and NR-insulin DNA-origami structures. Input-files are quantification files generated through Salmon Quantification Pipeline. Script is comprised of a R-Markdown file, where parameters of the path to Salmon Quantification files, path to output folder and path to metadata can be changed in the header. Metadata files include transcription factor annotation to investigate the occurence of transcription factors among the DE-genes. 
NOTE: The variable "index" in the section of acquiring the quantification files needs to be changed depending on the path to the quantification files.
