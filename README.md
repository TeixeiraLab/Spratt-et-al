DNA-PAINT codes to filter non-specific binding events, unwanted localizations and calculate the distance between clusters.

RNA-seq codes to analyzie transcription sequencing data from mouse adipocytes treated with both free insulin and NR-insulin DNA-origami structures. Input-files are quantification files generated through Salmon Quantification Pipeline. Metadata files include transcription factor annotation to investigate the occurence of transcription factors among the DE-genes.
